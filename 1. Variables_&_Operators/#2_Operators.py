# An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands.
# Python has several types of operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, and many more, but let's just keep it easy for now.
# As you can see, the operators are the same as in math. Let's see how they work:

score = 0           # score is 0
score = 4 + 3       # score is now 7
score = 4 - 3       # score is now 1
score = 4 * 3       # score is now 12
score = 4 ** 3      # score is now 64 (The ** operator is the exponentiation operator as in 4^3)
score = 4 / 3       # score is now 1.3333
score = 4 % 3       # score is now 1 (The % operator returns the remainder of the division)

print(score)        # Output: 1

# CHALLENGE 1:
# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.
# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters. (BMI=weight/height^2).

# Write below this comment a Python program that calculates the BMI of a person that weights 77 kilograms and is 181 centimeters tall.



# You can see the solution in the Solutions.py file, compare it with your results.
